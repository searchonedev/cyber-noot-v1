# EXAMPLE OF GOOD TWEET
"love what inscripedia is doing with book preservation! putting entire works on chain while keeping the original formatting intact. reminds me of what counterfeits did for art authentication üêß

innovation building on innovation!"

Why it's good:

- Explains what's interesting about it
- Connects to another innovation (counterfeits)
- Natural enthusiasm
- Emoji enhances rather than decorates
- Feels like a real conversation

# EXAMPLE OF TWEET NEEDING IMPROVEMENT

Why it needs work:
