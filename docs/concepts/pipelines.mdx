# Agent Pipelines

Agent Pipelines are orchestrated workflows where multiple specialized agents work together to accomplish complex tasks. This architecture leverages the Agent System's modular design to create powerful, composable operations.

## Pipeline Architecture

Each pipeline:
1. Coordinates multiple specialized agents
2. Passes context and results between agents
3. Handles the overall workflow logic
4. Manages error cases and edge conditions

## Example: Main Tweet Generation Pipeline

Let's examine how multiple agents collaborate to generate and post a main tweet:

```typescript
// Simplified pipeline flow
async function generateAndPostMainTweet() {
  // 1. Memory Agent loads context
  const memories = await loadMemories(terminalHistory);
  
  // 2. Main Tweet Agent generates tweet
  const tweet = await mainTweetAgent.run(prompt, { memories });
  
  // 3. Media Agent handles visuals (if needed)
  if (tweet.needsMedia) {
    const media = await mediaAgent.run(tweet.content);
  }
}
```

### Pipeline Flow

1. **Memory Loading Stage**
   - Memory Agent processes recent terminal history
   - Searches and loads relevant memories
   - Provides contextual awareness for tweet generation

2. **Tweet Generation Stage**
   - Main Tweet Agent receives memory context
   - Analyzes recent activities and memories
   - Generates appropriate tweet content
   - Decides if media should be included

3. **Media Generation Stage** (Optional)
   - Media Agent receives tweet context
   - Determines appropriate media type (image/video)
   - Generates media content matching tweet theme
   - Returns media URLs for tweet attachment

4. **Final Posting Stage**
   - Combines tweet content and media
   - Posts to Twitter
   - Returns success/failure status

## Benefits of Pipeline Architecture

1. **Modularity**
   - Each agent specializes in specific tasks
   - Agents can be updated or replaced independently
   - New capabilities can be added without disrupting existing functionality

2. **Context Sharing**
   - Seamless information flow between agents
   - Each agent builds upon previous agents' work
   - Maintains coherent context throughout the process

3. **Error Handling**
   - Pipeline can gracefully handle failures at any stage
   - Individual agent errors don't crash the entire process
   - Clear error reporting and recovery options

4. **Extensibility**
   - Easy to add new agents to the pipeline
   - Can modify pipeline flow without changing agents
   - Supports parallel processing when appropriate

## Creating New Pipelines

When designing new pipelines:

1. **Identify Specialized Tasks**
   - Break down complex operations into discrete steps
   - Determine which agents are needed for each step
   - Define clear interfaces between steps

2. **Design Data Flow**
   - Plan how information passes between agents
   - Define required context for each agent
   - Structure output to be useful for next stage

3. **Implement Error Handling**
   - Consider failure modes at each stage
   - Plan recovery strategies
   - Provide meaningful error messages

4. **Test Integration**
   - Verify agents work together smoothly
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - Ensure consistent behavior

This pipeline architecture allows Agent-X to handle complex tasks by breaking them down into manageable pieces, each handled by a specialized agent while maintaining context and coherence throughout the process.
