# Hivemind Memory System

The Hivemind Memory system is a sophisticated architecture that gives Agent-X both short-term and long-term memory capabilities, enabling it to maintain context, learn from interactions, and evolve over time.

## Memory Architecture Overview

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Short-term Memory**: Recent terminal logs and chat history
2. **Memory Processing Pipeline**: Extraction and summarization of learnings
3. **Long-term Storage**: Categorized memories in [mem0](https://mem0.ai/) database

## Memory Categories

Memories are stored in distinct categories:
- World Knowledge
- Crypto Ecosystem Knowledge
- Self Knowledge (Agent's own thoughts/opinions)
- User-specific Knowledge
- Main Tweets
- Image Prompts

## Memory Processing Flow

### 1. Learning Extraction
- An extractor agent processes the short-term terminal history
- Extracts key learnings in three categories:
  - General knowledge
  - User-specific insights
  - AI self-reflections

### 2. Memory Summarization
- Implements a hierarchical 5-3-1 summarization system:
  - Short-term summaries (≥5 entries)
  - Mid-term summaries (≥3 entries)
  - Long-term summary (consolidated knowledge)
- This creates a sense of "present time" for the hivemind

### 3. Memory Loading
- A specialized memory agent queries relevant memories based on context
- Searches across all memory categories
- Returns formatted, categorized results for the agent to process

## Memory Evolution

The system enables continuous learning and evolution through:
- Regular meditation cycles (every 24 hours)
- Daily learning consolidation
- Category-specific memory organization
- Hierarchical summarization for maintaining temporal context

This architecture allows Agent-X to maintain coherent conversations, remember past interactions, and evolve its understanding over time while preventing memory degradation or conflicts.
