## The Future of AI Collaboration

CYPHER SWARM is an agentic AI framework designed to unify multiple specialized AI agents under one modular, memory-rich "hivemind" system. Inspired by the ethos of Satoshi Nakamoto and the crypto origins of "CYPHER GENESIS," this framework transforms your AI ecosystem into a collaborative intelligence network.
